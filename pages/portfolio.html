                <p class="pdescription part1">
                    During my different trainings I encountered a lot of diverse tools that are being used during different stages of development. As such, for my first website ever, I tried to collect all those tools, link to their respective websites, and add a quick despcription for them for any potential future reader.
                </p>
                <p class="pdescription part2">
                    Planned to be completely remade in React and only show the sites from a specific selection instead of all of them at once.

                <p class="pdescription part1">
                    A Website we made during training to consume an API, in this case Chuck Norris Facts, with some additional graphics.

                <p class="pdescription part1">
                    The Final Group Project during my Web Development training, done entirely in php with Laravel. The link goes to the Github page since I couldn't find a free hosting platform for php websites.
                </p>
                <p class="pdescription part2">
                    My part in the project was to design and create the database and the migrations as well as the final presentation of the project and some of the back-office and all the online research for the project, including all the pictures. As such not very much of the actual code of the website is made by myself. The basic designs of the database however are added as pictures to the project to be able to see them at a glance.

                <p class="pdescription part1">
                    A small website with a table of Lego sets, complete with their serial number and picture, a well as a sorting function created in AJAX
                </p>
                <p class="pdescription part2">
                    My little nephew, for whom I created this website, lives in the Philippines. As such, it's hard to track what sets he owns directly, so I made this little website to keep track of everything.

                <p class="pdescription part1">
                    A car rental API that we did as final project during my API training, programmed under Python with FastAPI.
                </p>
                <p class="pdescription part2">
                    Was uploaded to Heroku, however due to the recent licensing changes which eliminated the free acccounts, the API is offline now. As such, I linked the gitlab account entry, where you may need to be invited in as guest to see the code.
